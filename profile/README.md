Since this project team is a commercial project team, but due to the lack of subsequent funding support, this repository is being archived. Thanks to XHash and Plancker for their financial support.

# Langlands

Langlands is delivered from The Langlands Project which was proposed in 1967 suggesting a profound connection between disparate mathematical objects like number theory and harmonic analysis, akin to a grand unified theory of mathematics. Langlands Team envisioned a bridge linking various ZKP and basic operator accelerators by a complete open source software under Apache V2 license, to provide a transparency experience to developers and users.

# Our Goal

Instead of focusing on creating value for Langlands community, Langlands hopes that every contributor can achieve their own value by removing the burdens from their shoulders.

# The problems we hope to solve

Address the current lack of robust Chinese and English learning resources for Zero-Knowlegde Protocol
Researching and optimizing ZKP protocols, focusing on efficiency in limited computational environments.

# What are we doing now

We are currently focusing on studying existing protocols (Nova, HyperPlonk, and Binius) and producing high-quality content in both Chinese and English to promote the development of the ZKP field.
